# nando_automation_demo
## Running the Demo 
####Prerequisites:####
Python, pip, boto, and awscli are required to be installed and configured.
Once awscli is installed, use aws configure to provide aws access keys.

**Install pip:**

OSX:
```
==> sudo easy_install pip
```
Ubuntu:
```
==> sudo apt-get install python-pip
```
Amazon Linux/Redhat/CentOS/Fedora:
```
==> sudo yum install python-pip
```
**Install packages and configure:**
```
==> sudo pip install boto awscli
==> aws configure
```
Prepare to launch command (replace XXXX with your instagram keys):
```
==> git clone https://github.com/stelligent/nando_automation_demo.git
==> cd nando_automation_demo
==> export INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
==> export INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
####All-In-One Amazon AWS automated demo from a single cli command:####
```
==> ./go.py build
```
Options:
* -l xx.xx.xx.xx yy.yy.yy.yy : list IP's from which to limit access. (Default: open to all)
* --region us-xxxx-# : Build stack is specific region. (Default: us-east-1)

To destroy a stack created by this script run:
```
==> ./go.py destroy
```
A list of launched stacks will be displayed from which you can select the one to destroy.abacdd

- Cloud Deployment with [CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

- Configuration Management with [Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet).

- Continuous Delivery with [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/), [CodeDeploy](http://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

- High Availability with [ELB](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) and [ASG](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/).

- [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for static templates, manifests, encrypted keys, and demo outputs.

- [RDS](http://aws.amazon.com/rds/) for storing image tags and paths.

- [IAM](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/) and [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) roles and policies for security.

- [ElasticBeanstalk](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) for [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

- Testing via [ChaosMonkey](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki/Chaos-Monkey), [ServerSpec](http://serverspec.org/), [TestKitchen](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen), [Cucumber](https://cukes.info/), [OWASP ZAP](https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/), [CloudCheckr](http://cloudcheckr.com/), [evident.io](https://evident.io/), and [Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/).

- [Vagrant](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/) for Developer Environments.


This demo creates ElasticCloud and VirtualPrivateCloud infrastructure and deploys inside with one command. One pipeline control box with Puppet and Jenkins, a CodeDeploy Nginx/PHP-FPM Application via AutoScalingGroup, a Docker container via ElasticBeanstalk, private subnet Multi-AZ HA RDS databases , and ElastiCache for temporary user session data. ElasticLoadBalancers, resolved by Route53 RecordSets, sit in front of both CodeDeploy and Docker web tiers. SimpleStorageService is used for authenticated retrieval of static templates, manifests, and encrypted keys needed upon resource bootstrap. S3 is also used for the running demo to store logs and other outputs securely.

http://nando-automation-demo.elasticoperations.com displays two random Instagram images. The end-user selects their prefered image, and then proceeds to click thru a series of images pairs (CodeDeploy). Based on the user's selections, an Instagram image slideshow is generated and displayed (Docker).  S3 stores the images, RDS stores the path and tags, and ElastiCache stores the end-user's session data. Jenkins continually delivers the CodeDeploy application, as well as the Docker container, thru all stages of the Continuous Delivey Pipeline. 

Jenkins jobs running Video:

Acceptance tests ensure the all resources are up and working correctly, and that the application and environment are secure.

# questions

- Use [delivery pipeline](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Delivery+Pipeline+Plugin) plugin?
- Diagram of the stages and activities in the deployment pipeline?
- Deployment time?
- How do you get feedback after running the ```deploy.nando.automation.demo.sh``` script? For example, the URL of the working application?
- It seems that Jenkins gets launched with the ```deploy.nando.automation.demo.sh``` script?
- How does Vagrant get launched by the user/developer?
- Use [Dashing](http://dashing.io/) dashboard  to show metrics? (Jonny has a CFN template)?
- Make CloudFormation work in multiple regions and AZs
- Consider using m3 default instance types
- Are you doing any encryption (in transit or at rest?)?
- Rename CloudFormation and other resources to Stelligent
- Purpose of restricting IP endpoints in command?
